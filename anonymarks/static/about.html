	<h2>No account needed</h2>
	<p>You don't need to sign up for an account to store bookmarks
	  here, or give us any information about yourself. You just
	  need a password or phrase to identify yourself. This can be
	  anything you like, as long as other people can't guess
	  it.</p>

	<p>You may find it's easier to use a short phrase rather than
	a single word. Perhaps pick a sentence at random from a
	book. But don't use anything predictable like a well-known
	saying.</p>
