	<h3>How is this different from other bookmarking
	services?</h3>

	<p>The key difference is that you don't need a username to
	store bookmarks. There's no signup or verification process,
	just your passphrase. This means it's very quick to get
	started and easy to log in again, but it also means that if
	anyone were ever to break into our database, there's no
	information to identify you.</p>

	<p>You also have <em>deniability</em>. Since anyone who
	stumbles across your passphrase can edit or add to your
	bookmarks, it's difficult to be certain that any bookmark in
	particular was posted by you.</p>

	<p>The idea of Anonymarks is fast, easy bookmarking that's
	secure and private <em>enough</em>. If you're worried about
	the government observing everything you do, this might not be
	the service for you. On the other hand, if you want to
	organise your data with extra privacy but without extra
	hassle, this might work for you.</p>

	<a name="bookmarks_stored_forever"><h3>Will my bookmarks be stored forever?</h3></a>

	<p>It's hard to say for certain. I don't want to have to
	delete any bookmarks, but if the service suffers from abusive
	usage (spam or flooding) then I may not be able to continue to
	provide the service to legitimate users if I don't delete the
	abusive bookmarks. While I'll always try to avoid affecting
	legitimate users, the anonymous nature of the site means that
	there might be some collateral damage.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, this is a free service. Hosting a reasonable
	number of bookmarks for even a large number of people ought to
	have fairly trivial costs, but if it gets very popular and the
	costs start to mount up, I may have to start trimming
	bookmarks. If so, I'll do this on the basis of least recently
	used bookmarks being deleted first.</p>

	<a name="browser_bookmarks"><h3>Why can't I bookmark pages on
	Anonymarks in my browser?</h3></a>

	<p>Mostly this would be pointless. Anonymarks is designed to
	avoid leaving a trail on your computer showing what you've
	been bookmarking, so directly linking your computer to your
	page on Anonymarks defeats the object.</p>

	<p>However, maybe you have one secure computer that you trust,
	and still want anonymous access to your bookmarks from other
	computers. This is quite reasonable, but not something we
	support just yet. It's not obvious if this can be done without
	significantly compromising security.</p>

	<a name="illegal_purposes"><h3>Can I use this for illegal
	purposes?</h3></a>

	<p>Of course you <em>can</em> (at least, you can bookmark
	illegal content, whether or not the act of bookmarking is in
	itself illegal). The question is whether supporting illegal
	activity is something this site encourages, or whether I'll be
	doing my best to prevent it.</p>

	<p>Quite honestly, I'd prefer it if nobody used this service
	in such a way as to further illegal activity. I'm not any sort
	of anarchist, and although I have my disagreements with some
	laws, I consider the democratic process to be legitimate and
	I therefore respect the law.</p>

	<p>However, I don't see it as my role to police the
	service. Anonymarks can only be used for storing short pieces
	of textual data, the kind of thing that could otherwise easily
	be written on pieces of paper. It's hard to see how this can
	make a great difference to the ease with which crimes can be
	committed. Therefore I don't see that I have a moral duty to
	interfere with what people choose to store.</p>
