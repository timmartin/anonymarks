	<a name="how_secure"><h3>How secure are my bookmarks?</h3></a>

	<p>It's probably best not to say any more than
	&ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;. The basic architecture of Anonymarks
	is built with privacy and anonymity in mind, and we've taken
	sensible security precautions. However, this site is still in
	development, and there can be bugs in anything. There's
	definitely more risk here than in a more mature site that's
	been carefully audited for security.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, bigger sites represent more tempting
	targets for hackers and the government intelligence
	services. Furthermore, many commercial cloud services
	deliberately gather data about you in order to maximise the
	value they get out of you as customers. We don't do that.</p>

	<a name="NSA"><h3>Can the NSA see what I bookmark?</h3></a>

	<p>Our data is stored in the cloud infrastructure provided
	by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>,
	which many people assume has been infiltrated by the
	NSA. However, merely looking at the database won't tell them
	all that much about you, since there's no personally
	identifying information stored in our system at all. If the
	NSA is after you, they're going to have much better luck
	observing your traffic as you visit the site at your ISP than
	by attempting to get data from our servers.</p>

	<a name="security_best_practices"><h3>What should I do to make
	    it more secure?</h3></a>

	<p>Choose a password that is as unpredictable as
	possible. Long phrases work as passwords, and can be both more
	secure and easier to remember than short strings of random
	digits.</p>

	<p>It's important not to bookmark things that personally
	identify you under the same account as sensitive
	bookmarks. For example, if you bookmark your friends blog,
	your place of work and your favourite sports team, it may be
	possible to work out who you are. If you have multiple
	accounts with unrelated passwords, it should be impossible to
	draw any connections between one set of bookmarks and the
	other.</p>

	<a name="admin_access"><h3>Can Anonymarks admins see what
	    I bookmark?</h3></a>
	
	<p>Yes, although there's nothing that personally identifies
	you on our system. We don't have any interest in looking at
	what people choose to bookmark.</p>

	<a name="differences"><h3>How is this different from other
	bookmarking services?</h3></a>

	<p>The key difference is that you don't need a username to
	store bookmarks. There's no signup or verification process,
	just your passphrase. This means it's very quick to get
	started and easy to log in again, but it also means that if
	anyone were ever to break into our database, there's no
	information to identify you.</p>

	<p>You also have <em>deniability</em>. Since anyone who
	stumbles across your passphrase can edit or add to your
	bookmarks, it's difficult to be certain that any bookmark in
	particular was posted by you.</p>

	<p>The idea of Anonymarks is fast, easy bookmarking that's
	secure and private <em>enough</em>. If you're worried about
	the government observing everything you do, this might not be
	the service for you. On the other hand, if you want to
	organise your data with extra privacy but without extra
	hassle, this might work for you.</p>

	<a name="bookmarks_stored_forever"><h3>Will my bookmarks be stored forever?</h3></a>

	<p>It's hard to say for certain. I don't want to have to
	delete any bookmarks, but if the service suffers from abusive
	usage (spam or flooding) then I may not be able to continue to
	provide the service to legitimate users if I don't delete the
	abusive bookmarks. While I'll always try to avoid affecting
	legitimate users, the anonymous nature of the site means that
	there might be some collateral damage.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, this is a free service. Hosting a reasonable
	number of bookmarks for even a large number of people ought to
	have fairly trivial costs, but if it gets very popular and the
	costs start to mount up, I may have to start trimming
	bookmarks. If so, I'll do this on the basis of least recently
	used bookmarks being deleted first.</p>

	<a name="browser_bookmarks"><h3>Why can't I bookmark pages on
	Anonymarks in my browser?</h3></a>

	<p>Mostly this would be pointless. Anonymarks is designed to
	avoid leaving a trail on your computer showing what you've
	been bookmarking, so directly linking your computer to your
	page on Anonymarks defeats the object.</p>

	<p>However, maybe you have one secure computer that you trust,
	and still want anonymous access to your bookmarks from other
	computers. This is quite reasonable, but not something we
	support just yet. It's not obvious if this can be done without
	significantly compromising security.</p>

	<a name="illegal_purposes"><h3>Can I use this for illegal
	purposes?</h3></a>

	<p>Of course you <em>can</em> (at least, you can bookmark
	illegal content, whether or not the act of bookmarking is in
	itself illegal). The question is whether supporting illegal
	activity is something this site encourages, or whether I'll be
	doing my best to prevent it.</p>

	<p>Quite honestly, I'd prefer it if nobody used this service
	in such a way as to further illegal activity. I'm not any sort
	of anarchist, and although I have my disagreements with some
	laws, I consider the democratic process to be legitimate and
	I therefore respect the law.</p>

	<p>However, I don't see it as my role to police the
	service. Anonymarks can only be used for storing short pieces
	of textual data, the kind of thing that could otherwise easily
	be written on pieces of paper. It's hard to see how this can
	make a great difference to the ease with which crimes can be
	committed. Therefore I don't see that I have a moral duty to
	interfere with what people choose to store.</p>

	<a name="multiple_accounts"><h3>Can I have more than one
	account?</h3></a>

	<p>There's really no way we can tell whether you have one
	&ldquo;account&rdquo; or several. Go ahead, knock yourself
	out.</p>

	<a name="https"><h3>Why don't you use HTTPS?</h3></a>

	<p>The main reason is that Anonymarks is a free service, and
	secure HTTP costs money to provide. If I can see that the
	service is popular, I hope to upgrade this in the future. If
	you want to encourage
	me, <a href="http://static.anonymarks.net/contact.html">a
	donation of bitcoin</a> would help a lot.</p>

	<a name="trust"><h3>How can I trust a little site like
	this?</h3></a>

	<p>You have to decide for yourself who to trust. Bear in mind
	that the larger companies represent very attractive targets
	for the government and for hackers, since they have so much
	information and so much of it is personally identifiable. By
	contrast, cracking our system won't give anyone very much at
	all of interest.</p>
